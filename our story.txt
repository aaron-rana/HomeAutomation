IT all started with 4 college buds discussing the idea of creating something that will put a considerable difference to modernize the famine of electricity wastage in India. From back of the envelop scratches to the making of the prototype, we have kept in mind the hurdles of Indian market and economy and how to bring out maximum from the minimum we get. We worked round the clock to fill in every gap it may or may not create. This is the just the beginning  to the journey of making our project reach the masses and anneal the digital India with striving India.
